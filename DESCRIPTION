Description: The Reproducible Open Coding Kit (ROCK, and this package, `rock`)
  was developed to facilitate reproducible and open coding, specifically
  geared towards qualitative research methods. Although it is a
  general-purpose toolkit, three specific applications have been
  implemented, specifically an interface to the `rENA` package that
  implements Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), means to process notes
  from Cognitive Interviews (CIs), and means to work with a decentralized
  construct taxonomy (DCT).
