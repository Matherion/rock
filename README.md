# Reproducible Open Coding Kit (ROCK)

The Reproducible Open Coding Kit (ROCK, and this package, `rock`)
was developed to facilitate reproducible and open coding, specifically
geared towards qualitative research methods. Although it is a
general-purpose toolkit, three specific applications have been
implemented, specifically an interface to the `rENA` package that
implements Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), means to process notes
from Cognitive Interviews (CIs), and means to work with a decentralized
construct taxonomy (DCT).
